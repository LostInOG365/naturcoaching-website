- **Contact form** (UI available, backend integration pending)
- **Responsive design** for mobile devices

## Technologies

🚧 **Work in progress**

The website is functional but not yet ready for production. Currently in progress:
- Layout optimizations and fine-tuning
- Backend integration for contact form
- Database connection for blog functionality
- Final design polishing

## Learning objectives

This project also serves to expand my web development skills, in particular:
- More complex website structures with multiple subpages
- Integration of forms and databases
- Responsive design
- Transition from one-page to multi-page websites

## Background

While retraining as an IT specialist for application development, I am creating this website in parallel to apply and deepen my front-end knowledge in a practical way.
